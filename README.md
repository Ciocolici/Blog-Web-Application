# Capstone Project 3: Blog Web Application
A project made while doing "[The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)" Udemy Course. 

It contains a Blog web application using Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js and EJS, which allows the user to create, edit, delete and display blog posts. They do not persist through sessions because there's no database.
Being a Node.js project, to be run the project requires a server. You can run it locally with NPM in Visual Studio Code using the terminal: 
1. make sure you have node.js installed, open the project's folder with Visual Studio code, open the terminal and write the following:
2. cd "path to the project's folder"
3. npm i
4. node index.js
5. the Web Application can now be accessed with http://localhost:3000/
